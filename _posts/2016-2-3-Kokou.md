title: Kokou no Hito
---

Just finished reading the rock climbing manga Kokou no Hito in one sitting. 
Seems speed reading comes in handy to eliminate awesome things from bothering you.
Manga is very intense kind of Yowamushi Pedal in a more dark psychological way, it is very twisted and may hit home for the mature audiences.
