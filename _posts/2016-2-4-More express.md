title: more ExpressJS things
---

Finding articles on expressJS and found that loopback is not always the go to choice for node framework solutions. <br>
People seem to avoid loopback due to lacking documentation or community active enought to produce quality tutorials.<br>
ExpressJS was the go to due to simplicity and easy to understand guides.<br>
If you are looking for API things with node, check Express JS out.<br>
